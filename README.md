# Prework Webpage Study Guide

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students going through the prework. It contains several notes relating to HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript that I consider helpful for first time developers to study and potentially reference later in the boot camp program.

## Usage

To use the Prework Study Guide you load up the webpage. Once on the webpage you will see four individual sections labeled HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript with notes specific to that topic. You can also open the Chrome DevTools by using CTRL+Shift+I on Windows or Command+Option+I on MacOS. From the console of Chrome DevTools you will be able to see some JavaScrift functions at work. One function lists the four topics that the study guide shows notes for, and the other JavaScript function will suggest a random topic for you to study first.
